      src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-two.jpeg"
      alt=""
    />

    <!-- Between the first and second <h2> tags, add another paragraph to the post using the <p> tag: -->
    <p>
      “If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
      But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help
      you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a
      schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying about
      blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out
      prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most.
      Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!”

    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

      src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-three.jpeg"
      alt=""
    />

    <!-- After the last <h2> tag, add a final paragraph that says: -->
    <p>
      “Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be
      uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about
      expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
      express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll
      be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be
      on your feet all day long, so be prepared.”
